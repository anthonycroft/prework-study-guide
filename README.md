# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who are going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

It serves as a handy desktop reference to some of the more important commands and syntax of the foundational technologies of web developmment.

I was motivated to do this to keep a record of what I have learnt on the course which I can add to over time as my knowledge of the subject areas grows. I expect to include new subjects and technologies as my knowledge and experience expands over time.
